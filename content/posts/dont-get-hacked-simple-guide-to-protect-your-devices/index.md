**Warning!** This isn't an extensive guide on how to protect yourself from
getting hacked. This is just a simple guide that everyone and their grandma can
do (at least to some extent)

{{< /alert >}}

Recently, one of my friend got hacked, and he is quite educated and considered
as tech savvy. There's also a [NFT influencer got
hacked](https://techstartups.com/2023/01/16/google-ads-delivered-malware-drains-crypto-influencer-nft-god-entire-crypto-wallet/)
not too long ago. You would think this would never happen to a tech influencer!

There aren't enough resources on teaching simple ways to protect your online
identity. And as more people move their lives online and with the latest
generation growing up living almost fully online. Everyone should learn about
protecting their safety online.

# Steps
Easy steps that everyone can do to not get hacked.

## Don't just use one account
**Use separate Gmail accounts, at least one for work, one for personal life.**

I know there are many people who use one Gmail account for everything online.
Be it personal or work/school related, it's just so convenient to do so. Heck,
I was even doing this before I learned how to protect myself online. 

If your Gmail account is compromised, even with two-factor authentication, you
still at risk of other accounts getting hacked.

## Don't use the same/similar passwords
**Use an offline password manager to manage different passwords for different
accounts.**

This becomes worse if you are using the same accounts as well. If your Gmail
account and bank account uses the same email and passwords, a hacker getting
access to one means he can access the other. Use a password manager instead of
using the default browser password manager.

If you are using variant of your passwords, it is objectively better 

## Don't "remember your password"
**Don't use the remember password features especially when it's saved online.**

For example, Google Chrome allows users to save accounts and passwords and sync
all the credentials on the cloud. This way, no matter what devices you are on,
you can easily access your credentials. 

Pretty neat, huh? But this also makes you more vulnerable to attack. The
attacker could access all the passwords you saved online if you system is
compromised. 

## Don't use simple passwords
**Use a randomly generated passwords that is at least 8 characters long with
capital letters, numbers and symbols.**

Type your password on https://howsecureismypassword.net/ 

Is it easy to crack? Change it to a random passwords. The easiest way to do so
is to use password manager that have this function. 

How do you remember your passwords if it's not iloveyou? You don't! And that's
the beauty of it, just let the password manager do it's thingy. With a password
manager, you could generate a random password that is virtually impossible to
crack.

## Don't click on random links
**Only click on legitimate links, research unfamiliar links on Google**

Hackers will make their links look like a real one. We should always check the
links before clicking, make sure its an legitimate source.

As seen in the image, the URL is
[https://giveawaysei-nitro.com](#dont-click-on-random-links) and a real Discord
giveaway link would be
[https://discord.gift](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500001829622-Claiming-a-Nitro-Gift-FAQ)

You don't have to do extensive research on a link before clicking onto it, just
be careful of the random links people sent you or you found. Google it to make
sure the website is real and not shady.

{{< alert "check" >}}
If you want to download something free that you normally have to pay for.
Please don't go randomly download it from a website. 

I am not saying that you should, but you could torrent the
softwares you want. And if you do, make sure the torrent has a
high seed ratio. That makes it a whole lot safer. 

If you have no idea how to stuff, I will shill my [torrenting
post](/posts/torrent) here to you.

## Avoid proprietory softwares
**Whenever you can, always use free and open-source software (FOSS). Don't use
softwares where the code can't be audited by others.**

Not only does FOSS give the users more privacy and security, these softwares
are generally better than the proprietary counterparts. Hate the Adobe PDF viewer? Me too! 
Search "FOSS PDF viewer and editor" and install one that you like.

Because these softwares are open-source, everyone can audit the code to fix
security issues. Also, for the better or worse, not a lot of people know FOSS
exists and less people use those software, That means A hacker wouldn't waste
their time in hacking an obscure software that little people uses.

## Avoid online services
**Whenever you can, don't use any tech.**

Use cash. Reduce internet usage. E wallets If you don't use an e-wallet
regularly or at all, no hacker can hack you! Just keep enough cash in your
pocket for daily life.

Don't use QR code to order something on a menu when you can do it offline! No
one can hack your phone because you wrote your order on a menu. Would it make
it you look weird because you are the only one refusing to scan QR code? Yes.
But you have the right to do so.

# Convenience (a lack thereof)

If you haven't notice, to be more secured could means less convenient. But only
if you are using the wrong softwares. By using a local password manager, you
could achieve 4 of the 7 steps above and still have conveniency. Next post,
I will go over my favorite free and open-source password manager, KeepassX.
