## Free and Open Source Softwares (FOSS)

Many businesses still are not aware of the power of open-source softwares or
have misconceptions about them. FOSS aren't just free in terms of cost, they
are free in customization, in which their proprietary counterparts do not have.
This means FOSS can be customized into just what a business need with little
cost.

However, heavy customization of the softwares do mean you need to be (or have)
someone with decent technical knowledge. to customize the softwares to fit what
you need.

It could help greatly improve the efficiency of website design,
development, testing, debugging, auditing, hosting and maintenance. My FOSS
consultation also elevate the efficiency of internal operations while keeping a
minimal cost.
