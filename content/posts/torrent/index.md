**Warning!** I don't condone online piracy of any form. Also, don't come to me
if you got yourself into trouble from torrenting. Torrent at your own risk.

An easy to understand guide for torrenting.

## How
First, you will need a torrenting client, I started out using
[Tranmission](https://transmissionbt.com/download). Another favorite of mine is
[qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php). This guide will be use
Transmission as example.

After downloading your client, let's say you want to torrent something
**totally legal** like an Arch Linux ISO. First, you would need a magnet link
of the ISO file. You can go to the [official Arch Linux
website](https://archlinux.org/download/) and look for a magnet icon.

Or if you are like me and would like to get your magnet link on sites like
Piratebay, you can also head to Piratebay or similar site, search "Arch Linux".
Searching ["piratebay" on Yandex](https://yandex.ru/search/?text=piratebay)
will give the links to Piratebay. Right click on the magnet and hit "Copy Link"
or "Copy Link Address".

Open Transmission, click File, then open URL, if you already copied the link,
the link will be pasted in. If not, just go ahead and copy the link in again.

## Giving Back
The file you torrented came from some other people. And they seeded (shared)
the file with you so you can have it. Always remember to seed after feed.

A good courtesy is to seed at least 1.0 ratio of what you torrented, that way
you make sure at least 1 other person has it. If you are generous, do seed for
more!

## Nerd Stuff
Torrenting is quite an interesting technology. Rather than downloading a file
from a single source (e.g. website), you are getting the file from many other
machines (i.e. seeders). And if there are more seeders, your download would
generally be faster.

For anyone that's not tech savvy and is not interested in the nerdy stuff. Just
think of torrenting as downloading, and seed the torrent after downloading for
others.

## Risk
There are some risks from torrenting:
1. If you are downloading copyrighted contents, you run the 
risk of getting DMCA letters.
2. People can see your public IP address and could DDOS you.

You can get more details just by searching.

### Minimizing Risk
One of the most common ways is to use a VPN. And this is probably the only
valid reason to have a VPN. You can use whatever VPN out there (do try to avoid
the free ones tho).

If you want to use a paid one, you can use [my Surfshark VPN
link](https://surfshark.club/friend/szFAuUXj). If you use my link and stay with
Surfshark for more than 1 month, you and I both get 1 month of free VPN. Yay!

Or you can just get any other VPNs out there. Just go on YouTube and you will
find others shilling for them (even more shamelessly than me).
