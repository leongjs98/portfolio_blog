## Web Development Experiences

As an experienced full-stack web developer, I know the website development
cycle like the palm of my hand. While I did many work in designing and
developing the front-end of an application (i.e. how an application looks), my
expertise lies in the backend development.

I also have extensive knowledge in website hosting and maintenance on Linux
servers. I have helped clients to host and maintain most of their websites.

## Free and Open-Source Softwares (FOSS)

I love helping people understand FOSS, clear out misconceptions about them and
help implementing FOSS into businesses and personal life. In fact, this website
is made possible by amazing open-source softwares like the [Hugo
framework](https://gohugo.io/) and [Blowfish theme](https://blowfish.page/).
