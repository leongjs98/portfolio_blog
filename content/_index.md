## Web Development Experiences

As an experienced full-stack web developer, I know website development cycle
like the palm of my hand. While I did many work in designing and developing the
front-end of an application (i.e. how an application looks), my expertise lies
in the backend development.

I also have extensive knowledge in website hosting and maintenance on Linux
servers. I have helped clients to host and maintain most of their websites.

## Free and Open Source Softwares (FOSS)

I love helping people understand FOSS, clear out misconceptions about them and
help implementing FOSS into businesses and personal life. In fact, this website
is made possible by amazing FOSS tools like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and
[Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/).
