As I came close to graduate as an Electronic and Electrical Engineer, I

## Linux

Linux is a MUCH better operating system than Windows (both server and desktop).
And so I ditched Windows in May of 2022 and never looked back. Now I am daily

## Hobbies

I also participate in martial arts and/or combat sports to keep myself healthy
and sharp. My first love is Muay Thai (Thai Boxing), and started training
Brazillian Jiu Jutsu since the December 2021.
