# Personal Blog & Portfolio

This a personal blog and portfolio built with [Hugo
framework](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Blowfish
theme](https://blowfish.page/).

## Setup

# Make sure the submodule cache is cleared
git rm --cached themes/blowfish

git submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish
```

## Roadmaps
### Blog Topics
Technology vs Rights
- Right of repairs diminishes
- Ownership slowly disappearing, people are renting devices
- Culty fanboys can't think better, outsiders shitting on them makes them stick to the cult harder
- People afraid of change, not knowing better, not switching to better softwares and hardwares
- Laptops manufacturers bending over for microsoft and force everyone over to Windows 11 when it wasn't ready

### Portfolio
Add technical skills sets in card

### Blogs
1. Have a [nested parent
   menu](https://blowfish.page/docs/getting-started/#nested-menus) topics menu
   on navbar for different topics
2. Allow others to create pull request on github to co-author articles
